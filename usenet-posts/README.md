It seems that the old Usenet resources are more and more difficult to find.
Google Groups does not allow access to raw posts, disabling unpacking of shar archives.
Therefore I have copied all my source code posts arhcived in http://ftp.fi.netbsd.org/pub/misc/archive/alt.sources and added it here.
In each subdirectory there is a *.share file with the original post, and archive.txt file informing about the original location in the above archive.
