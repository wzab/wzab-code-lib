This is the updated version of my automated test generator and scanner.
I have updated it to:
1) Work with Python 3
2) Use Python virtaul environment and automatically install necessary
extensions
3) Use pilibdmtx instead of old pydmtx

The old (slightly updated) desctription follows:

Checking of multiple choice test is always boring and (therefore?) error prone.
I always wanted to make it automatically. There are different commercial
programs able to make it automatically, but I wanted to have something
open and free.
The presented system uses the DataMatrix 2D bar codes to allow automatic
scanning of the test answers.
The idea is very simple.
The test sheet contains the codes corresponding to each answer.
The student checks (blurs) the code corresponding to the selected answer.
The scanned test sheet is then analyzed and all remaining codes are detected.
The lacking codes are those who have been selected.

This archive contains two Python scripts:
1) test_gen.py - this script generates in the "patterns" subdirectory
   the PNG files which should be included in your test.
   The LaTeX demo_test.tex file is an example how to do it.
2) test_scan.py - this script analyses the filled and scanned test
   The values " min_edge=80, max_edge=150 " are good for the
   scan with 600 DPI. You should adjust them for 300DPI scan.
The archive contains also the sample test "demo_test.tex"
To check how does it all work, you should:
a) Generate the PNG files with encoded answers:
   $python test_gen.py
b) Generate the test PDF: $pdflatex demo_test
   Print it, fill it, scan it with 600DPI to "scanned_test.png" file
c) Run the analyzer:
   $python test_scan.py

For correct operation you need the PIL library for Python
(http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ )
and the libdmtx library with Python wrapper
(http://libdmtx.sf.net)
